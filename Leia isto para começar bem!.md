# Python to AI from Scratch - Introducing Python

## Introduction to Programming

### Getting Started with Learning Python

Learning Python can be approached in various ways, much like any other skill. However, some methods might be more complex than others. For instance, you could dive into extensive documentation, but that might not be effective unless you grasp the essential concepts and practice as you learn. So, let's take a different approach.

Let's start with the basics:

## Python:
- Python is a high-level programming language.
- It's an interpreted scripting language.
- It follows an imperative programming paradigm.
- Python is object-oriented.
- It has functional programming capabilities.
- It boasts dynamic and strong typing.

In simpler terms:
- Python employs a high-level syntax, which resembles human language in its interconnected components.
- Unlike compiled languages, Python doesn't require code compilation. It's interpreted, executed line by line.
  - This is made possible by CPython, embedded in Python installations, serving as an interpreter for bytecode.
  - Bytecode is an immediately executable form, bridging the gap between source code and the final application.
- Python's imperative nature allows you to give direct commands without compiling to system-specific language and binaries.
- Functions are the building blocks of Python, making it a functional language.
- Dynamic typing means variables can change type during runtime, following compatibility rules (strong typing).
- Python's object-oriented nature involves using classes and objects to perform tasks. We'll delve into this concept later. For now, grasp that OOP is a programming paradigm, just like functional programming – another paradigm Python supports.

## Language Elements

Similar to how human languages have grammatical rules for cohesion and coherence, programming languages organize linguistic elements for logical structure. When connected appropriately, these elements form structures that communicate data to perform specific functions within an application.

Additionally, programming languages have counterparts to grammatical classes, such as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs. In Python, these counterparts include variables, data types, values, control structures, and more.

Let's explore them!

### General Elements
- **Variables:** Used to store and manipulate values.
- **Data Types:** Define the type of value a variable can hold, like integers, floating-point numbers ("decimals"), strings (words), and more.
- **Operators:** Enable mathematical operations, value comparisons, and more.
- **Control Flow Structures:** Manage program execution flow, determining which code block should run in specific situations.
- **Functions:** Reusable code blocks that perform specific tasks or operations.
- **Comments:** Non-executable text explaining the code, improving readability for other programmers.

### Special Elements
- **Indentation:** Vital in Python, as it defines code structure. It indicates which code should execute within a block, like a function or a loop.
- **Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries:** Data types to store sets of values.
- **Modules:** Files containing function, class, and variable definitions that can be reused in other programs. A collection of related modules is a library.
- **Classes and Objects:** The foundation of Python's OOP. A class 'defines' – creates a blueprint – and an object 'instantiates' the class through its behavior. For example, a class 'Car' can have various objects, like 'sedan' and 'SUV,' representing different instances of that class.
- **Lambda Expressions:** Anonymous functions used for simple, temporary tasks.
- **File Handling:** Python allows reading, writing, and manipulating files on disk, such as databases or text files.
- **Standard Modules:** Python includes a range of standard modules offering additional functionalities like date/time processing, text manipulation, encryption, and more.
- **Package Managers:** Python features a package management system to install and manage third-party libraries, adding extra functionality to your application.
